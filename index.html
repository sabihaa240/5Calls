<ol class="how-to">
<li><strong>Choose an issue you care about</strong>
<p>Make calls in support of progressive issues. We update the list regularly as legislation develops and remove topics as soon as they're no longer relevant. If you don’t see your issue on the list, please reach out at hello@5calls.org.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Enter your location</strong>
<p>Next, we'll figure out who you need to call. We can find your location for you, or you can enter a zip code or address manually. If your ZIP code is in more than one Congressional district we may show our best guess for your representative. Use an address or cross streets to more accurately locate you.</p>
</li>

<li id="privacy-notice">
    <p><em>Your location stays private. We don’t store it and we never sell data to third parties.</em></p>
  </li>

<li><strong>Make your calls</strong>
    <p>We’ll provide you with a script and tell you who to call for your chosen issue, from Representatives and Senators to Governors and Attorneys General. Once you mark the result of your call, we’ll show you the next person’s number.</p>

            <h2>Why Calling Works</h2>

            <h3>Calling your congressperson is the most effective way to influence policy.</h3>
            <p>Once your congressperson forms a public stance 
            on an issue, it's hard for them to walk it back. 
            The earlier they hear your opinion, the more likely 
            it is you'll make an impact. Calling is by far 
            the most effective way to ensure that your 
            representative hears you before they take a public stance.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>No matter their politics, calling works.</h3>
            <ul class="noMatterList">
                <li>
                    <p><strong>If you support their stance…</strong>
                    You need to let your congressperson know! When they 
                    talk to colleagues, they use call tallies and personal 
                    stories from constituents to better support their positions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>If you oppose or don't know their stance…</strong>
                    Calling is the easiest way to sway them! Your 
                    congressperson gets regular call tally reports, letting 
                    them know how strongly their constituents feel about an 
                    issue.</p>

                    <p><strong>Why can't I send a letter or email instead?</strong></p>
                    <p>Calling is by far the most effective way 
                    to reach your congressperson. To learn more, 
                    check out our guide to why calling works.</p>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Why do I only see my House or Senate representative?</strong></p>
                    <p>Depending on the issue, voting may have 
                    already happened in one chamber or the other, 
                    or the issue may not be active in that chamber. 
                    We regularly update who needs to be called based on 
                    legislation status so you can receive the right information.</p>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Can I save time by mentioning multiple issues in the same call?</strong></p>
                    <p>Sometimes! This largely depends on the office 
                    and how they tally calls, but you can always ask. 
                    For cases where they can't tally multiple issues, 
                    you can call right back or spread your calls out 
                    over the day.</p>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>What if I really don't like talking on the phone?</strong></p>
                    <p>Calling on evenings and weekends with the intent of 
                    leaving a voicemail is still a great way to make your 
                    voice heard. Congressional offices are usually open during 
                    normal business hours in their local time zone.</p>

            <h2>Who To Call First</h2>

            <div id="who-to-call-paragraphs">
                <p>Start with their D.C. office. When you open an issue 
                page, we start with your congressperson's Washington, D.C. 
                office. You should call that one before trying a local office.</p> 

                <p>If no one picks up, leave a voicemail. Congressional 
                offices check voicemail every day. They will tally your 
                message just like a call. Make sure to mention your street 
                address in the message. That way, your congressperson 
                will know you are a constituent.</p>  

                <p>After-hours voicemails are a great way to make your 
                voice heard if you aren't comfortable talking to someone 
                directly.</p>

                <p>If you can't get through, call their local offices. 
                Your senators will have a few local offices. Since 
                they represent your entire state, it doesn't matter 
                which one you call, even if it's far away from you.</p>  

                <p>If you can't get through, we know it's frustrating. 
                Congressional offices have recently been seeing record 
                call volume.</p>

                <p>If you can't reach your congressperson, that usually 
                means a lot of people cared enough to call. That's 
                amazing! Don't sweat it and try again later.</p>
